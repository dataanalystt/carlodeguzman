            <h3>Data Analyst </h3>
            <p style="font-size: 14.5px;">As a 4th-year Business Analyst student at FEU – Institute of Technology that will hopefully graduate next year, I was curious about what future endeavors 
                will I be challenged with when I will graduate.
                
                <br> <br>I received a call from a marketing agent about the opportunity to become a data analyst. 
                Recognizing the potential for a fulfilling and exciting career in this field, I immediately enrolled in Refocus to fast-track my education 
                and training in data analytics. I was excited to have this opportunity and was committed to making the most of it. 
                Through my studies at Refocus and as a Business Analyst Student, 
                I gained a strong foundation in the tools and techniques used in the field, as well as the practical 
                experience needed to succeed as a data analyst. I also participated in a group project assignment where 
                our cooperation, data analytics skills, and presentation skills were tested. While enrolled in Refocus, I also completed 
                online certifications like Google Data Analytics and a proctored exam certificate in IT-Specialist – Databases. 
                Until now, I have set other long-term certifications that will develop my talents and skills as a future Data Analyst.
